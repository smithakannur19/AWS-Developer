Hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this lecture.
This lecture is just a really quick update
all about S3 performance.
So let's get started.
Now, in July 2018,
Amazon announced a massive increase in S3 performance.
And on their website they state
that they can support at least 3,500
put requests per second.
So that's uploading files.
And 5,500 get requests per second.
So retrieving your files.
And this new increased performance
negates the previous guidance
to randomize your object keynames
to achieve faster performance.
This means that logical and sequential naming patterns
can now be used without any performance implication.
Now, as you probably know,
The Amazon ecosystem, it changes on a daily basis.
And as you can imagine, the certification exams
can sometimes become a little outdated
or out of sync with the latest updates.
So just be aware that in practice,
you no longer need to avoid sequential naming
of your S3 objects.
But you may still see questions
in the exam related to randomizing keynames
as mentioned in the previous lecture.
And I'm sure they are going to update the exam eventually.
But it just can take some weeks or months
for the exams to reflect any new updates in the services.
So that is the end of this lecture.
It's just a really quick one
to let you know about that performance update.
If you've got any question or feedback
please let us know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.
