Okay, hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this very quick lecture.
So, perhaps you've already done
The Solutions Architect exam,
and perhaps you've done the
A Cloud Guru Solutions Architect course,
and now you want to go on and do the developer one.
There is some overlap between the two.
Not as much as there used to be.
It used to be that if you've done
The Solutions Architect Course,
you could basically just go do the DynamoDB section
of the developer exam, of the developer course I mean,
and then you'd be able to pass.
That's not longer the case.
The new developer associate exam is very, very difficult.
It is actually pretty much the most difficult
associate exam as it exists today
and you do need to do quite a bit more.
So which sections can you skip?
Well, you can skip Chapter 2, Identity Access Management,
because then that is just the basics
of how to set up users, how to set up groups,
apply policies et cetera.
So if you know how to do that already,
you can definitely skip it.
You can skip Chapter 3, which is just basic EC2 stuff,
so provisioning EC2 instances,
provisioning RDS instances, et cetera.
And you can skip parts of Chapter 5.
So you can skip it if you have done it
in the Solutions Architect course.
So this is where we create the serverless websites,
so you have a basic serverless website,
we then have the serverless website using Polly,
and then we have the Alexa skill.
You can definitely skip that.
But only those lectures.
You definitely need to do the ones on X-Ray.
You're going to need to do the ones
on step functions et cetera.
So that is pretty much all you can skip.
The rest of the course, you do have to do
if you have a chance at passing
The Certified Developer Associate.
So wishing you the best of luck.
I hope you really enjoy this course, it is very hands on
and you are going to learn an awful lot.
So let's move on
