Hello, Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lecture,
where we're going to take a closer look at CodePipeline.
And of course, CodePipeline is a fully managed CI/CD service
which orchestrates the build, test,
and deployment stages of your software release process.
And you can configure CodePipeline to trigger the pipeline
every time there's a change to your code.
For example, if you're using CodeCommit
to store your source code
and you make some updates to your code,
then this can trigger CodePipeline to begin the build, test,
and deployment processes automatically,
just like a conductor in an orchestra,
controlling everything, directing and orchestrating
the entire process so you don't have to.
And by using an automated release process like this,
it means that your release process is going to be faster,
more consistent, and with fewer mistakes,
and it really enables the quick release of new features
and bug fixes in your software.
But how does it do all of this?
Well, it actually integrates
with a whole bunch of other AWS tools
as well as some third-party open source tools.
So think CodeCommit, CodeBuild,
and CodeDeploy for the AWS developer tools.
It also integrates with open source tools
like GitHub and Jenkins.
And if you haven't used Jenkins before,
it's an open source application which can be used
to build, test, and deploy your application.
CodePipeline also integrates with Elastic Beanstalk
and CloudFormation,
as well as Lambda and Elastic Container Service.
And if you haven't used Elastic Container Service before,
it's a fully managed platform which allows you to run
containers like Docker as well as Windows containers in AWS.
So let's take a look at an example CodePipeline workflow,
and you'll see how CodePipeline integrates
with all the other developer tools
that we've been talking about.
So once your workflow has been defined,
it all begins when a change is detected
in your code repository.
And in this case, the code repository is CodeCommit.
So new code appears in our CodeCommit repo,
and that is detected,
and immediately CodeBuild comes in
and compiles the source code,
runs any tests that you've defined,
and produces packages which can be used
to deploy your software.
And then finally, CodeDeploy comes in,
and the newly built application is then deployed
into either a staging or production environment.
So all of this can be done automatically,
and this is an example of a CI/CD,
continuous integration and continuous deployment
or delivery workflow,
all orchestrated using CodePipeline.
So let's take a look at some of our CodePipeline exam tips.
First of all, just remember it's a CI/CD service,
so it orchestrates your end-to-end software release process
based on a workflow that you define.
It can be configured to automatically trigger your pipeline
as soon as a change is detected
in your source code repository.
And finally, it integrates with lots of AWS tools,
as well as some third-party tools.
So think CodeCommit, CodeBuild,
and CodeDeploy for the AWS developer tools,
and for the third-party open source tools,
it also integrates with GitHub and Jenkins,
as well as things like Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation,
Lambda, and Elastic Container Service.
So that is the end of this lecture.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.
